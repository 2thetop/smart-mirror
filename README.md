# Smart Mirror
This project is inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). It uses [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) for voice interactivity and is my own take on what a "smart mirror" really can be.

##### Why start from scratch?
Starting from scratch was less about other projects not being good enough and more about my own learning experience. While I did get a lot of insperation from other projects I really wanted this to be my own!

##### Try it before you buy it:
Not really, it's totally free. Check it out: [https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/](https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/).
Note that there is some missing config information on the GitHub. I have hesitations about checking in an API key... So until I decide to *asdf* and check it in, weather wont work. 

##### More info to come soon!
