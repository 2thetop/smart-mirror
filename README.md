# Smart Mirror
This project is inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). It uses [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) for voice interactivity and is my own take on what a "smart mirror" can be.

##### Why start from scratch?
Starting from scratch was less about other projects not being good enough and more about my own learning experience. While I did get a lot of insperation from other projects I really wanted this to be my own!

##### Try it before you buy it:
Not really, it's totally free. Check it out: [https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/](https://evancohen.github.io/smart-mirror/).
Note that there is some missing config information on the GitHubs. I have hesitations about checking in an API key... So until I decide to *asdf* and do it anyway, weather wont work. 

##### More info:
Favicon from [In the Wake of the King](http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2014/03/17/in-the-wake-of-the-king/), a head nod to **The Watcher** â€“ "A byblow of the king and a queen of the sea, she has remained apart from the workings of her family, more home beneath the waves, watching all through water and mirror. Her ambitions lie outside the Eternal Kingdom, but her secrets are valuable everywhere."

Awesome.
